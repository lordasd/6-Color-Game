# 6 Color Game - Readme

## Overview

**Developer:** David Zaydenberg  
**Description:**  
This is a recreation of the **6 Color Game** using **SFML** and **C++ STL** with an implementation of a generic graph data structure. The game features a board with colors and shapes, where players take turns capturing tiles by selecting colors. Players can challenge the computer at three difficulty levels: *Random*, *Greedy*, and *Global Greedy*.  

## Features

- **Graph-Based Game Board:** A generic graph data structure (templated for hexagonal nodes) powers the game mechanics.
- **Dynamic Difficulty:** Opponent AI with increasing complexity:
  - **Random AI:** Selects random colors.
  - **Greedy AI:** Chooses the most common color among its immediate neighbors.
  - **Global Greedy AI:** Uses DFS to find the most dominant color across multiple levels of neighboring nodes.
- **Interactive UI:** 
  - Displays player and computer tile capture percentages.
  - Buttons and options to choose difficulty or exit the game.
- **Resettable Board:** Automatically resets when a new game starts.

## Architecture

### **Main Components**

1. **Main.cpp:**
   - Initializes the game with a `Controller` instance.
   - Sets the random seed for consistent random behavior.
   - Runs the main game loop.

2. **Controller Class:**
   - Manages game states (*Menu, Gameplay, Win, Lost, Exit*).
   - Handles input events and game flow.
   - Delegates actions to the `GameBoard` and `Opponent` components.

3. **GameBoard Class:**
   - Creates and manages the **Graph** of hexagonal nodes.
   - Executes operations like capturing tiles and traversing the graph.
   - Manages the board's UI overlay (e.g., buttons, score display).
   - Resets the board for new games.

4. **Opponent AI Classes:**
   - **Base Class:** Defines a pure virtual `makeMove` function.
   - **RandomOpponent:** Randomly selects a color.
   - **GreedyOpponent:** Chooses the most frequent neighbor color.
   - **GlobalGreedyOpponent:** Uses DFS to evaluate deeper neighbor connections.

5. **UI Components:**
   - Renders buttons, text, and score overlays.
   - Ensures buttons are unclickable after selection.

6. **Graph Class:**
   - A generic templated graph structure.
   - Includes a `Node` structure representing individual tiles.
   - Supports iterators for graph traversal (implemented in a separate file).

### **Other Components**

- **MainMenu:** Renders the main menu and manages difficulty selection or game exit.
- **Window:** Creates and provides an `sf::RenderWindow` instance.
- **Color Manager:** Provides random color selection and manages color comparison (e.g., for maps).

## How to Play

1. Launch the game.
2. Choose a difficulty level from the main menu (*Random, Greedy, Global Greedy*).
3. Play by selecting a color to capture tiles. The computer will take turns based on its AI logic.
4. The game ends when all tiles are captured. The player with the most tiles wins.
